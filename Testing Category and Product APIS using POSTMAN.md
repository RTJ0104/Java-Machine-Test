Postman is a popular tool used for developing, testing, and documenting APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to make HTTP requests, test responses, and debug web services. It supports various types of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), making it a perfect tool for testing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in APIs.
